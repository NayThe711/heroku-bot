# Discord-Bot
A discord js bot I did for fun for my server that I run with my friends.

This bot is coded using discord.js which is Node.js and using heroku as its hosted server.

# What is this Discord-bot project about?

 This project is about me learning a how to code and host a bot and running 24/7 for groups of friends on discord. This bot is a sub bot of a bot that I created bot for a gaming server on discord for a group of people in a clan, which will not be shown due to the sensitive data for that clan. This bot will be running similar commands and also new commands that were not put into the bot used in the gaming server.
