# Discord-Bot
A discord js bot I did for fun for my server that I run with my friends.

This bot is coded using discord.js which apart of Node.js and using heroku as its host server.

This bot is intended as a backup bot incase my main server bot crashed and failed to restart despite using pm2 start index.js

If you are interested in seeing my bot in action, you are welcome to join my server,
